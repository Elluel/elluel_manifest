Themed holo taken from my old CM11 theme, holo is ugly ([screenshot](http://puu.sh/er8Od.jpg)).  Only two commits so revert them if you hate it.
Personal preference changes.

If you don't like something then revert it.

Not posted anywhere but yes you can build it yourself if you really want to for whatever reason:

repo init -u https://github.com/Lethargy/lethargy_manifest.git -b lollipop  
repo sync -f  
. build/envsetup.sh  
lunch  
make bacon
