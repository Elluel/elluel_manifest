Whatever I want in a ROM.  

Themed holo taken from my old CM11 theme ([screenshot](http://puu.sh/er8Od.jpg)).  Only two commits so revert them if you hate it.  
Other various personal preference changes.

If you don't like something then revert it.

Not posted anywhere but feel free to build it yourself if you really want to for whatever reason:

repo init -u https://github.com/Elluel/elluel_manifest.git -b lollipop  
repo sync -f  
. build/envsetup.sh  
lunch  
make bacon
